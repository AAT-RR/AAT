  <h2>About the Audio Analysis Tool (AAT)</h2>
  <p>The Audio Analysis Tool (AAT) is a comprehensive application designed for working with WAV audio files. It supports a range of audio analysis functionalities such as THD, Rub&Buzz, Noise detection, Frequency Response, and Sensitivity calculation. The tool can be run with command-line options or in GUI mode and is compatible with both Windows and macOS.</p>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Management and Playback:</strong> Easily load single or multiple WAV audio files, select an active file for analysis, and play them back with a clear time display. You can also view detailed file information such as sample rate, bit depth, channels, and file size. Loaded files can be managed by deleting selected ones or clearing all.</li>
    <li><strong>General Processing Options:</strong> Customize your analysis with options like channel selection (left, right, or both), A-weighting to approximate human hearing, and gain adjustment in dB.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio Analysis Functions:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Audio Waveform:</strong> Visualize the audio signal's amplitude over time, with options for channel selection, A-weighting, gain, and zoom. You can even plot waveforms for all loaded files for comparison.</li>
        <li><strong>FFT Spectrum Plot:</strong> Analyze frequency components, identify tones, and understand spectral balance using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Parameters include FFT Size (N) for resolution, plotting all files or delta for comparison, and logarithmic frequency scaling.</li>

  <h2>AAT Tool Interface Screenshots: Tonal Noise Scan Example</h2>
  <p>Here are some screenshots of the AAT Tool interface, including an example of the Tonal Noise Scan visualization:</p>

  <h3>How Scan Tonal Noise Works (A Simplified Explanation)</h3>
  <p>Our Scan Tonal Noise feature is designed to automatically find those annoying, constant "whines" or "hums" in your audio files, especially useful for checking products on a production line. Think of it like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We take your audio file and quickly break it down into tiny slices of sound, like looking at snapshots of what frequencies are present over time.</li>
    <li>For each snapshot, we look for any specific musical notes or tones that are significantly louder than the surrounding background noise. It's like finding a single loud whistle in a room full of murmurs.</li>
    <li>Then, we track these loud "notes" over time. If a particular note stays loud and consistent for a certain period, our tool identifies it as a potential "tonal noise."</li>
    <li>Finally, based on some smart rules we've set (like how loud it has to be or how long it has to last), the system decides if this tone is a problem. It can even count how much "problem tone" occurs in total. This helps us quickly tell if a product passes or fails the noise test, without needing a human to listen to every single one.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is Tonal Noise?</h3>
  <p>Tonal noise refers to a type of noise characterized by its distinct, stable, and often continuous pitch. Unlike broadband noise, which spreads across a wide range of frequencies, tonal noise is concentrated at one or more specific frequencies, making it sound like a hum, whine, buzz, or whistle.</p>

  <h4>What Causes Tonal Noise?</h4>
  <p>Tonal noise is usually caused by things that involve repetitive motion or electrical currents. It sounds like a steady hum, whine, buzz, or whistle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tonal noise is identified if a spectral peak is perceptibly higher than neighboring bands.</li>
    <li>The tone can be detected visually in a spectrum or audibly.</li>
    <li>ISO 1996-1:2016 uses subjective and empirical rules for identification.</li>
    <li>**Rotating Parts:** Motors, fans, pumps, and gears.</li>
    <li>**Electrical Components:** Transformers and power supplies, often due to electromagnetic vibrations.</li>
    <li>**Fluid Movement:** Steady flow in pipes.</li>
  </ul>

  <img src="https://github.com/AAT-RR/AAT/raw/main/5ktonal.png" alt="Tonal Noise Example Plot" class="responsive-img">
  <p>This plot illustrates tonal noise. The prominent line clearly indicates a continuous, stable tone standing out from other frequencies. This line represents the identified tonal noise component.</p>

  <p>This image demonstrates how the system identifies tonal noise based on its definition. It highlights spectral peaks that are perceptibly higher than their neighboring frequency bands, indicating the presence of a tonal component as per the ISO standard.</p>

<h2>scan Tonal noise Analysis Parameters Explanation </h2>

<h3><code>enable_abnormal_noise_detection = True</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This simply turns on or off the system's ability to <strong>detect specific, sustained abnormal noises</strong> in the audio. Setting it to <code>True</code> means the system will actively look for these noises.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>noise_freq_range = (1000, 18000)</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This defines the <strong>frequency band where the system will look for abnormal noise</strong>. In this case, it will only consider sounds between 1000 Hz (like a mid-range tone) and 18000 Hz (a very high-pitched sound). Any noise outside this range will be ignored for abnormal noise detection. You set this based on where you expect the problem noise to occur.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>noise_db_threshold = 8.0</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is how much <strong>louder a noise has to be compared to the general background noise</strong> for it to be considered "significant" or "abnormal." If a sound is only slightly louder than the background, it might be normal variation. A value of <code>8.0</code> means it needs to be 8 decibels louder to be flagged. You can adjust this to make the detection more or less sensitive.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>min_abnormal_noise_duration = 0.5</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This sets the <strong>minimum length of time a specific noise has to continuously exist</strong> to be counted as an "abnormal noise event." For example, <code>0.5</code> seconds means a very brief pop or click won't be flagged, but a sustained hum or whistle will be if it lasts longer than half a second. This helps filter out transient sounds that aren't sustained problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>noise_peak_prominence_db = 8.0</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This helps the system identify a <strong>clear "peak" within the frequency range</strong>. It means that a noise needs to stand out by at least <code>8.0</code> decibels from the surrounding frequencies to be recognized as a distinct noise component, rather than just a slight bump in the overall sound. It's about how much the noise "sticks out" from its immediate neighbors in the frequency spectrum.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>noise_peak_width_bins = 2</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This describes <strong>how "wide" a noise peak needs to be</strong> in the frequency spectrum. A value of <code>2</code> means the noise has to span at least two frequency "bins" (small frequency segments) to be considered a valid, distinct noise. This helps avoid detecting extremely narrow, often artificial or insignificant, peaks.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>noise_freq_tracking_tolerance = 80</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a <strong>"wiggle room" for frequency changes</strong> when tracking a continuous noise. If a noise's frequency shifts slightly (e.g., a 5000 Hz hum briefly goes to 5050 Hz or 4980 Hz), this tolerance of <code>80</code> Hz allows the system to still consider it the <em>same</em> continuous noise event. If it shifts too much (more than 80 Hz), it will be considered a new or different noise.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>noise_peak_smoothing_kernel = 5</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This parameter is purely for <strong>making the frequency plot look smoother</strong>. When the system tracks noise frequencies over time, the raw data can look a bit jagged. This setting helps "average out" those jitters in the visual graph, making the trends easier to see. It doesn't change the detection results, just how they are displayed.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>max_allowed_cumulative_noise_duration = 7.0</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a <strong>pass/fail limit for the total accumulated time of a specific noise frequency</strong>. If any single abnormal noise frequency (like that 5000 Hz hum) adds up to more than <code>7.0</code> seconds of total activity throughout the entire audio file, the system will flag it as a "FAIL." This is a key threshold for your overall quality assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>enable_cumulative_noise_analysis = True</code></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This switch turns on or off the system's ability to <strong>calculate the <em>total accumulated time</em> for each unique noise frequency</strong> found. Setting it to <code>True</code> means the system will do this calculation and compare it against the <code>max_allowed_cumulative_noise_duration</code> to give you a pass/fail result.</li>
</ul>


  
  <h2>Command-Line/python Call Usage: Scan Tonal Noise Analysis (For Production Lines)</h2>
  <p>
    The Audio Analysis Tool (AAT) features a <span class="highlight">unique, custom-developed Scan Tonal Noise Analysis function</span>,
    which is specifically designed for high-throughput testing environments
    like <span class="highlight">production lines</span>.
    This proprietary algorithm excels at rapidly detecting abnormal tonal noise events
    in audio files, providing quick Pass/Fail judgments and detailed reports.
    It can be integrated seamlessly into automated test sequences, requiring no human interaction
    to perform batch analysis and generate machine-readable output.
  </p>


  <h3>How to Call These Commands with Python(Prefer to use this method,save testing time):</h3>
  <p>Here's a simple Python sample code that demonstrates how to communicate with the AAT tool via a socket connection and execute audio analysis tasks.</p>
  <p>The script performs the following actions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>**Connects to the server:** Establishes a socket connection to `127.0.0.1` on port `12345`.</li>
    <li>**Gets Server Status (Optional):** Sends a `get_status` command to the server.</li>
    <li>**Loads WAV Files:** Sends an `open_wave_file_gui` command with a list of WAV file paths to be loaded by the server's GUI.</li>
    <li>**Runs Tonal Noise Analysis:** Sends a `run_scan_tonal_noise` command to analyze the loaded files. This command includes parameters for saving a combined plot image and overriding analysis settings like frequency range and threshold.</li>
    <li>**Clears Loaded Files:** Sends a `clear_all_loaded_files` command to clear the WAV files from the server's memory.</li>
    <li>**Saves Log:** Records the entire test process and results into a JSON log file.</li>
    <li>**Prints Summary:** Displays a summary of the test, including overall status, abnormal noise detection, and file-specific results.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Using Python to call these commands is a very effective method for automation and integration into your testing workflows.</strong>

  <h3>How to Use from Command Line for Tonal Noise Scan:</h3>
  <p>To leverage the Scan Tonal Noise Analysis function from the command line, use the <code>--console</code> flag along with specific arguments:</p>

  <pre><code>AAT.exe --console --input_wav &lt;file1.wav&gt; [&lt;file2.wav&gt; ...] --output_result &lt;output.json&gt; [--save_plot_image &lt;plot.png&gt;] [--ini_file &lt;config.ini&gt;]</code></pre>

  <h4>Arguments:</h4>
  <ul class="arguments-list">
    <li><code>--console</code>: This flag activates the console mode, enabling command-line execution without launching the full graphical user interface.</li>
    <li><code>--input_wav &lt;file1.wav&gt; [&lt;file2.wav&gt; ...]</code>:
        Specifies one or more input WAV audio files to be analyzed. Separate multiple file paths with spaces.
        Example: <code>--input_wav "C:\audio\test1.wav" "C:\audio\batch\test2.wav"</code></li>
    <li><code>--output_result &lt;output.json&gt;</code>:
        Specifies the path where the detailed analysis results will be saved in <span class="highlight">JSON format</span>.
        This structured output is ideal for automated parsing by other test programs.</li>
    <li><code>--save_plot_image &lt;plot.png&gt;</code> (Optional):
        If provided, a combined plot image (PNG format) containing the frequency tracking of all analyzed files will be saved to the specified path.
        If omitted, no plot image will be generated.</li>
    <li><code>--ini_file &lt;config.ini&gt;</code> (Optional):
        Specifies the path to an INI configuration file (e.g., <code>aat.ini</code>) containing parameters for the tonal noise detection.
        If omitted, the tool will look for <code>aat.ini</code> in the current working directory.
        If <code>aat.ini</code> is not found or is invalid, the tool will use default parameters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Example Commands for Production Line Integration:</h3>
  <p>To analyze multiple audio files, save detailed results to a JSON file, and generate a combined plot image:</p>
  <pre><code>AAT.exe --console --input_wav "D:\Test_Audio\Unit_A_Test1.wav" "D:\Test_Audio\Unit_B_Test2.wav" "D:\Test_Audio\Unit_C_Test3.wav"

    --output_result "C:\Production_Logs\Batch_XYZ_Results.json" --save_plot_image "C:\Production_Logs\Batch_XYZ_Plot.png"</code></pre>

  <p>If you only need the JSON output and no plot, simply omit the <code>--save_plot_image</code> argument:</p>
  <pre><code>AAT.exe --console --input_wav "D:\Test_Audio\Unit_A_Test1.wav" "D:\Test_Audio\Unit_B_Test2.wav" --output_result "C:\Production_Logs\Batch_ABC_Results.json"</code></pre>
